	<h2> Mountain View Chinese Christian Church</h2>
	<p><i>
	MVCCC is comprised of two different congregations. <strong>The English Congregation</strong> is a mix of students, single adults, and families. We are proud of the fact that we are an inter-generational church and
	we embrace this unique identity. <strong>The Chinese Congregation</strong> also meets on Sunday mornings (11am) and offers a Sunday Service, a number of fellowsip, small groups, bible study groups,
	and children programs in Mandarin Chinese.

	<h2>Our History</h2>
	<p><i>
	Started in the 1960s as a Home Bible Study Group under the guidance and assistance of Rev. Moses Yu, Chinese Christian Fellowship held its first
	worship service in 1964 in the hall rented from Masonic Temple. In 1974, it formally changed its name to Mountain View Chinese Christian Church,
	and on December 8, 1996, MVCCC moved into its current facility.
