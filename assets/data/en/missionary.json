We do this through culturally meaningful drama, music and worship, training teams, pastors and leaders in these various art forms, always working toward their effective communication of the Good News.  Our base is in Nairobi, Kenya, working with Daystar University and extending to other church and mission organizations to train in discipleship and evangelism using culturally meaningful drama and music.  We also empower them to reach out effectively to their own cultures and to areas closed to Western missionaries. </p><p>In our 3 years in Kenya we have held numerous short courses in drama and music, training around 200 lay leaders and pastors in these areas.  With teams we have trained we have also performed for thousands (in workshops and church services) through traveling drama teams and local church teams.  One of our most meaningful achievements is the Images Drama Project, which uses drama to help heal those affected by the post-election violence in 2007 and encourage the integration of Scripture into every part of the lives of Christians here.</p>"
