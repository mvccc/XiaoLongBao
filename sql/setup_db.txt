1. login as root/***
cmd line: mysql -u root -p ****
workbench+MAMP: localhost:8889@root/root

2. create database:
create database mvdb1;
show databases;

3. create dba users and grant privileges:
create user 'dba'@'localhost' identified by 'dba!mvdb';
create user 'dba'@'%' identified by 'dba!mvdb';

grant all privileges on mvdb1.* to 'dba'@'localhost' with grant option;
grant all privileges on mvdb1.* to 'dba'@'%' with grant option;
flush privileges;

4. if need another database for test or backup:
create database mvdb2;
show databases;
grant all privileges on mvdb2.* to 'dba'@'localhost' with grant option;
grant all privileges on mvdb2.* to 'dba'@'%' with grant option;
flush privileges;

5. create app users and grant privileges:
create user 'xiaolongbao'@'localhost' identified by 'woaichi';
create user 'xiaolongbao'@'%' identified by 'woaichi';
grant insert, select, update, delete on mvdb1.* to 'xiaolongbao'@'localhost';
grant insert, select, update, delete on mvdb1.* to 'xiaolongbao'@'%';
flush privileges;

Now we have 3 users: 
root - do everything, typically for database creation.
dba - do everything on mvdb1, typically for table creation.
xiaolongbao - do select/insert/update/delete on mvdb1 tables, apps use this account to connect.

To check grants for each user:
show grants for 'dba'@'localhost';

Need to restart database server to get those accounts take effect.
